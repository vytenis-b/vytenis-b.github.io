<p>A 16-story Soviet monolith â€“ a wannabe Optimus Prime apartment building â€“blocked the sun from our balcony. I was just about to launch my plastic bag on a string. No square kites on this launchpad. I had birch trees to my left, the tall, sad excuse for architecture at one oâ€™clock, and a failed attempt to pave over all of nature on the right â€“ a pothole ridden agora of concrete, boasting a statue of a rider on a horse. The horseâ€™s balls were spray-painted silver by local tribesmen. Our 5-story building snaked right up to the side of the agora. A small rock wall stood there, built with smashed up Jewish gravestones from destroyed cemeteries. If anyone knew this, they didnâ€™t talk, so unwitting lepers sat on it daily, mourning their loss of dignity with unrequited love for yeast shit.</p>

<p>I could see the gentle wind in the birches. In the distance, a bus puked out people into the agora. A good handful of years prior, plastic bags were a sign of high status, especially if they had a foreign logo, like Adidas or Aldi. Yet here I was, at the tail end of the 20th century, flying trash on a leash because that was the kite I could afford.</p>

<p>And I was getting good air too, man. Some days I could even get it above the monolith.</p>
